# How to Download Free OrCAD Libraries for Electronic Components
 
If you are looking for a free and easy way to design your own PCBs, you might want to check out OrCAD, a professional CAD software program that allows you to create schematic symbols, PCB footprints, and 3D models for millions of electronic components. OrCAD is compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1/10 and can be downloaded from [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/orcad/), a free online CAD library for Cadence OrCAD.

Here are the steps to download free OrCAD libraries from SnapEDA:
 
1. Search for a part. You can enter the part number or keyword in the search box on SnapEDA's website.
2. Download the OrCAD schematic symbol and PCB footprint for free. You can preview the symbol, footprint, and 3D model before downloading. You can also request a custom part if it is not available on SnapEDA.
3. Import the symbol and footprint into OrCAD. You can use the import wizard or drag and drop the files into your project. You can also edit the padstacks path if needed.

SnapEDA follows IPC-7351B standards for its footprints, and a combination of IEEE-315 and its own standards for symbols. All models are created by SnapEDA's component engineering team using a mix of automated and manual processes, and verified with a three-step verification process. You can learn more about SnapEDA's standards [here](https://www.snapeda.com/standards/).
 
If you need any component delivered in 24 hours, SnapEDA can also provide that service for only $29 (or less). You can browse top manufacturers such as Texas Instruments and Linear Technology on SnapEDA's website.
 
OrCAD is a powerful tool for electronics design, but it can be even more powerful with SnapEDA's free libraries. With SnapEDA, you can save hours on design and focus on your creativity. Try it today!
  
OrCAD is not only a schematic and PCB design software, but also a simulation and analysis tool. You can use OrCAD PSpice to simulate and verify your circuits before prototyping. OrCAD PSpice supports analog, digital, mixed-signal, and RF circuits, and comes with a library of over 33,000 models. You can also create your own models using the PSpice Model Editor.
 
OrCAD also integrates with other Cadence tools such as Allegro and Virtuoso for advanced design capabilities. You can export your OrCAD designs to Allegro for layout editing, routing, and manufacturing. You can also import your Allegro designs to OrCAD for schematic capture and simulation. OrCAD and Virtuoso work together for custom IC design, allowing you to create and simulate analog and mixed-signal circuits.
 
OrCAD is a versatile and comprehensive solution for electronics design, covering every stage of the design process from concept to production. Whether you are a hobbyist, a student, or a professional engineer, you can benefit from using OrCAD for your projects. You can download a free trial or upgrade your existing license from [OrCAD's website](https://www.orcad.com/).
