Synology Surveillance Station is a powerful video management system that allows you to monitor and record footage from IP cameras, I/O modules, intercoms, access controllers, IP speakers, and transaction devices. However, by default, you only get a limited number of licenses that come with your Synology NAS/NVR. If you want to add more surveillance devices to your system, you need to purchase additional licenses from Synology or authorized resellers.
 
But what if you don't want to spend money on extra licenses? What if you want to have unlimited licenses for your Synology Surveillance Station? Is there a way to get them for free or at a lower cost?

The answer is yes, but it may not be legal or ethical. There are some unofficial methods that claim to provide unlimited licenses for Synology Surveillance Station, such as using a license keygen generator, a hacked package, or a virtual machine. However, these methods may violate Synology's terms of service, warranty, and intellectual property rights. They may also expose your system to security risks, compatibility issues, and performance degradation.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using these methods to get unlimited licenses for Synology Surveillance Station. Instead, we suggest that you purchase the official license packs from Synology or authorized resellers. This way, you can enjoy the full features and benefits of Synology Surveillance Station without compromising its quality and security. You can also support Synology's development and innovation in providing reliable and user-friendly solutions for home and business users.
 
If you are interested in buying the official license packs for Synology Surveillance Station, you can choose from three options: 1, 4 or 8 Surveillance Device License Packs. Each pack comes with a single license key that allows you to activate 1, 4 or 8 surveillance devices at a time. The maximum number of surveillance devices supported on each Synology NAS/NVR depends on its model specifications. You can check the Camera Support List and Surveillance Device Support List on Synology's website for more details.
 
To activate or deactivate license keys on your Synology Surveillance Station, you need to connect to the Internet to access Synology's Authorization Server. If your NAS is designed to work in an offline environment, you can use DS cam app to process the license authorization.
 
Synology Surveillance Station is a great solution for managing your video surveillance system.
